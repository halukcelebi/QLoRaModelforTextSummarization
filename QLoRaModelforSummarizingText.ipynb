Nine patients in Germany had died of a form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, according to the World Health Organization, which cited Tuesday figures as its most recent. Six had died of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, EHEC, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines and can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. One person in Sweden has also died. Across Europe, 499 cases of HUS and 1,115 cases of EHEC have been reported, WHO said on its website. In addition to Germany and Sweden, cases have been identified in Austria, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. All but two of the cases occurred in people who had recently visited northern Germany or, in one case, had contact with a visitor from northern Germany, the organization said. Scientists at the Beijing Genomic Institute said the outbreak of infection in Germany is caused by a new \\\"super-toxic\\\" E. coli strain, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the strain has been seen before. \\\"We have very little experience with this particular strain, but it has been seen before,\\\" said Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC's division of foodborne diseases. The CDC said the strain is very rare and added that, while it is not aware of any cases ever having been reported in the United States, it is aware of a few previous reports of the strain in other countries. Britain's Health Protection Agency has said that the strain suspected in the outbreak is \\\"rare\\\" and \\\"seldom seen in the UK.\\\" Though WHO said it does not recommend any trade restrictions related to the outbreak, Russia announced a ban Thursday on fresh vegetable imports from the European Union. Russia imposed the vegetable ban because \\\"no one wants to get sick. It is a natural protective measure taken in response to events that are happening in Europe today,\\\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Thursday. Gennady Onishchenko, head of the Russian Federal Agency for Health and Consumer Rights, issued a statement saying the ban will remain in effect \\\"until we become convinced that this situation is resolved.\\\" Customs officials have been instructed to prevent the produce from entering the country, according to Onishchenko, while supermarkets and food chains in Russia were told to withdraw European vegetables from their produce bins. Frederic Vincent, the European Commission's health spokesman, called the move \\\"disproportionate.\\\" \\\"The commission will be writing today to the Russian authorities, and we will be liaising and working with them in the coming days to try to find a solution,\\\" Vincent said. The commission is the EU's executive body. Yelena Skrynnik, Russia's agriculture minister, issued a statement assuring Russians that, despite the ban, \\\"the volume of home-grown vegetable production combined with exports (from other countries) is sufficient to fully meet Russia's domestic demand.\\\" In 2010, the imports of tomatoes and cucumbers from the EU amounted to, respectively, 11% and 5% of all imports of those vegetables into Russia, the Russian Agriculture Ministry said. The ban could potentially affect some larger cities in the European part of the country, where about 90% of vegetables are imported, said Sergey Shugayev, chairman of the Rural Russia Association. China and Turkey are the two largest exporters of fresh vegetables into Russia, according to the Russian Greenhouses Association. The European Food Safety Alert Network initially said EHEC was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. But authorities said Thursday the source had not been pinpointed. Spain's Ministry of Health, Social Politics and Equality said Thursday that all samples of Spanish produce that it analyzed had proved negative. Spain's ambassador to Britain, Carles Casajuana i Palet, told CNN that Spanish produce had been \\\"completely cleared\\\" and are \\\"safe for all consumers.\\\" But, he added, the matter had damaged the country's growers \\\"and we are sure there will have to be compensations\\\" through the European Union. Britain's Health Protection Agency on Thursday confirmed that there were four new cases in England suspected to be related to the outbreak, bringing the total number of cases in the country to seven. The agency said that it was \\\"reminding people traveling to Germany to follow the advice of the authorities and avoid eating raw tomatoes, cucumbers and leafy salad including lettuce, especially in the north of the country, until further notice. In addition, anyone returning from Germany with illness including bloody diarrhea should seek urgent medical attention and make sure they mention their recent travel history.\\\" The ban on fresh vegetables from the European Union comes three days after Russia blocked the import of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and salad greens from Germany and Spain. On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates imposed a temporary ban on cucumbers from Spain, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.\",\n          \"By . Victoria Woollaston . When it comes to personal assistant apps, Google and Apple lead the way with their Now and Siri services. But Google may be trying to establish itself even further in the market, and steal an edge on its rival, following the purchase of Emu. Emu is similar to Google Now because it predicts what users want to do next, and offers relevant help - but it goes one step further. The firm claims the Emu app uses artificial intelligence to learn behaviours and fine tune suggestions in real time. Scroll down for video . Emu (pictured) is similar to Google Now because it predicts what users want to do next, and offers relevant help, but it goes one step further. The firm claims the Emu app uses artificial intelligence to learn behaviours and fine tune suggestions in real time, using contextual information. For example, Google Now alerts people to an upcoming flight, and informs them of traffic or public transport conditions before they leave. It can also remind people to take an umbrella, if it looks like it\\u2019s going to rain. The software in prediction apps is based on an algorithm that combines various snippets of information to form a prediction. In the case of personal-assistant apps, the software scans calendar entries to work out . where a user is, or should be. It combines this with location data, . taken from the device's GPS unit, as well as posts on social . networks, email information and more. It will then present the user with the help it thinks they need. For example, if a calendar on an Android phone contains a diary invite, Google Now will create a reminder. It will then check to see whether the . user is en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder, or . work out how long it will take them to get there based on current . traffic. Emu is slightly more advanced because it additionally scans and monitors conversations, in real time, to offer these suggestions automatically, and with context. If a friend asks a user where they are, Emu can send the location on a map, or if a friend asks to meet up on a particular day, Emu will check the user\\u2019s calendar to see if they\\u2019re free automatically. Location details can even be updated, live, for 30 minutes. Emu additionally scans and monitors conversations, in real time, to offer these suggestions automatically, and with context.

Emu was founded in 2012 by California-based ex-Google and Apple employee Gummi Hafsteinsson. Its \\u2018machine learning\\u2019 capabilities could provide Google Now with added context and faster response times, across different devices. The Emu team confirmed the acquisition in a blog post on Wednesday: \\u2018Hey, did you hear? We\\u2019re joining Google! \\u2018That\\u2019s right! And we\\u2019re super-excited. But to focus on our next chapter, we have to close the last one. \\u2018As of August 25, 2014, we\\u2019ll be shutting down the Emu app. \\u2018It will no longer be available in the App Store, and existing users won\\u2019t be able to send, receive, or download messages. We know it\\u2019s an inconvenience, and we regret that. \\u2018To our friends, advisors, and users: we\\u2019ve learned so much with your help, and we\\u2019re grateful for all your support.\\u2019 Emu's \\u2018machine learning\\u2019 capabilities could provide Google Now (pictured) with added context and faster response times, across different devices.

It is not known how much Google paid for Emu, and MailOnline has contacted the company for more information. This isn\\u2019t Google\\u2019s first foray into artificial intelligence. In January, the firm bought artificial intelligence firm DeepMind. Its Hummingbird search update last year was created to make Google 'more human', and searches can now understand context, like a human brain, for example. Google also hired futurist Ray Kurzweil as Engineering Director in 2012. Kurzweil has famously claimed that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity. He also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100.\",\n          \"By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 12:10 EST, 10 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:10 EST, 10 January 2013 . A New York man is being sued by his neighbors for allegedly allowing his children to take drugs and have threesomes on the roof of their luxury apartment building. Richard Kempter, 73, is accused of letting cannabis-fuelled parties take place in his one-bedroom flat when he is not around, leaving the entire Manhattan high-rise reeking of marijuana. But Mr Kempter has hit back saying that the lawsuit is racially motivated and targets his personal guests, as his children live miles away in a different state. Sue for smell: The neighbors allege that Mr Kempter, who lives on the eight floor of this building on the Upper East Side, allows his children to smoke cannabis and have sex on the roof when he is away . \\u2018My children are 40 years old and live in Michigan,\\u2019 the university psychology lecturer told the NY Daily News, adding that the \\u2018racist neighborhood\\u2019 does not approve of his black friends. Although management of the co-op owned high-rise received the lawsuit yesterday, the feud between Mr Kempter and his neighbors has been going on for years. \\u2018I opened my dishwasher on a clean load of dishes and the smell was overwhelming,\\u2019 a neighbor wrote to management of the Upper East Side building in January 2010, blaming \\u2018Richard\\u2019s stepson\\u2019. Last January another complained: \\u2018It is 10.45pm and my apartment smells like a party was going on\\u2026 the stench of musty pot that is lingering in my closet is unbearable.\\u2019 The lawsuit also includes accusations of . \\u2018lewd behavior\\u2019 after a woman, named in the lawsuit as \\u2018Chrissy\\u2019, was . caught on CCTV going up to the roof terrace with two men after dark, . which is prohibited by co-op rules. No to smoke: Neighbours say the cannabis smoke from the 'wild parties' in Mr Kempter's one-bedroom flat has spread throughout the building into their homes - even into their dishwashers and closets . Mr Kempter, who has lived in the building for 12 years, said he was aware that there had been complaints regarding his guests \\u2018getting rowdy\\u2019, and admitted that his friends \\u2018probably did have sex\\u2019 on the roof, but that the issues have already been resolved. The board of the co-op building had voted for him to be kicked out of the flat in march, but after Mr Kempter promised that the wild parties would stop he was allowed to stay. \\u2018I think there\\u2019s a racial issue here,\\u2019 he told the paper, adding that his friends named in the suit are all African-American. \\u2018This is a very racist neighborhood.\\u2019 The co-op is seeking $15,000 in damages, plus payment from Kempter for their legal bills.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9985,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"NEW: Interim head coach says the accusations are \\\"ludicrous\\\" and \\\"irresponsible\\\"\\nESPN reports that Saints GM Mickey Loomis could eavesdrop on opposing coaches .\\nThe Saints are already in hot water over their bounty program .\\nA Saints spokesman calls the report \\\"1,000% false\\\"\",\n          \"Radamel Falcao will join Manchester United on loan .\\nStriker had also been linked with Real Madrid, Manchester City and Arsenal .\\nFalcao heading to Manchester on a private jet from Nice .\\nArsenal spoke with Falcao's advisors on Friday .\\nColombian striker had looked likely to join Real Madrid .\",\n          \"Cox, 23, lost 6-3, 6-3 in the qualifying first round to Serbian Filip Krajinovic .\\nBroady lost a tight match to Tornado Alicia Black in two tiebreak sets .\\nJames Ward, Dan Evans and Dan Smethurst play on Wednesday .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

spread to 10 countries and is blamed for at least 16 deaths and hundreds of illnesses nine patients in germany had died of a form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome or hus according to the world health organization which cited tuesday figures as its most recent six had died of enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec a strain of e coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines and can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea one person in sweden has also died across europe 499 cases of hus and 1 115 cases of ehec have been reported who said on its website in addition to germany and sweden cases have been identified in austria denmark france netherlands norway spain switzerland and the united kingdom all but two of the cases occurred in people who had recently visited northern germany or in one case had contact with a visitor from northern germany the organization said scientists at the beijing genomic institute said the outbreak of infection in germany is caused by a new super toxic e coli strain though the u s centers for disease control and prevention said the strain has been seen before we have very little experience with this particular strain but it has been seen before said robert tauxe deputy director of the cdc s division of foodborne diseases the cdc said the strain is very rare and added that while it is not aware of any cases ever having been reported in the united states it is aware of a few previous reports of the strain in other countries britain s health protection agency has said that the strain suspected in the outbreak is rare and seldom seen in the uk though who said it does not recommend any trade restrictions related to the outbreak russia announced a ban thursday on fresh vegetable imports from the european union russia imposed the vegetable ban because no one wants to get sick it is a natural protective measure taken in response to events that are happening in europe today russian foreign ministry spokesman alexander lukashevich said thursday gennady onishchenko head of the russian federal agency for health and consumer rights issued a statement saying the ban will remain in effect until we become convinced that this situation is resolved customs officials have been instructed to prevent the produce from entering the country according to onishchenko while supermarkets and food chains in russia were told to withdraw european vegetables from their produce bins frederic vincent the european commission s health spokesman called the move disproportionate the commission will be writing today to the russian authorities and we will be liaising and working with them in the coming days to try to find a solution vincent said the commission is the eu s executive body yelena skrynnik russia s agriculture minister issued a statement assuring russians that despite the ban the volume of home grown vegetable production combined with exports from other countries is sufficient to fully meet russia s domestic demand in 2010 the imports of tomatoes and cucumbers from the eu amounted to respectively 11 and 5 of all imports of those vegetables into russia the russian agriculture ministry said the ban could potentially affect some larger cities in the european part of the country where about 90 of vegetables are imported said sergey shugayev chairman of the rural russia association china and turkey are the two largest exporters of fresh vegetables into russia according to the russian greenhouses association the european food safety alert network initially said ehec was found in organic cucumbers originating from spain packaged in germany and distributed to countries including austria the czech republic denmark germany hungary luxembourg and spain but authorities said thursday the source had not been pinpointed spain s ministry of health social politics and equality said thursday that all samples of spanish produce that it analyzed had proved negative spain s ambassador to britain carles casajuana i palet told cnn that spanish produce had been completely cleared and are safe for all consumers but he added the matter had damaged the country s growers and we are sure there will have to be compensations through the european union britain s health protection agency on thursday confirmed that there were four new cases in england suspected to be related to the outbreak bringing the total number of cases in the country to seven the agency said that it was reminding people traveling to germany to follow the advice of the authorities and avoid eating raw tomatoes cucumbers and leafy salad including lettuce especially in the north of the country until further notice in addition anyone returning from germany with illness including bloody diarrhea should seek urgent medical attention and make sure they mention their recent travel history the ban on fresh vegetables from the european union comes three days after russia blocked the import of fresh tomatoes cucumbers and

time using contextual information for example google now alerts people to an upcoming flight and informs them of traffic or public transport conditions before they leave it can also remind people to take an umbrella if it looks like it s going to rain the software in prediction apps is based on an algorithm that combines various snippets of information to form a prediction in the case of personal assistant apps the software scans calendar entries to work out where a user is or should be it combines this with location data taken from the device s gps unit as well as posts on social networks email information and more it will then present the user with the help it thinks they need for example if a calendar on an android phone contains a diary invite google now will create a reminder it will then check to see whether the user is en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder or work out how long it will take them to get there based on current traffic emu is slightly more advanced because it additionally scans and monitors conversations in real time to offer these suggestions automatically and with context if a friend asks a user where they are emu can send the

s first foray into artificial intelligence in january the firm bought artificial intelligence firm deepmind its hummingbird search update last year was created to make google more human and searches can now understand context like a human brain for example google also hired futurist ray kurzweil as engineering director in 2012 kurzweil has famously claimed that in just over 30 years humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal an event called singularity he also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100 \",\n          \"by sara malm published 12 10 est 10 january 2013 updated 12 10 est 10 january 2013 a new york man is being sued by his neighbors for allegedly allowing his children to take drugs and have threesomes on the roof of their luxury apartment building richard kempter 73 is accused of letting cannabis fuelled parties take place in his one bedroom flat when he is not around leaving the entire manhattan high rise reeking of marijuana but mr kempter has hit back saying that the lawsuit is racially motivated and targets his personal guests as his children live miles away in a different state sue for smell the neighbors allege that mr kempter who lives on the eight floor of this building on the upper east side allows his children to smoke cannabis and have sex on the roof when he is away my children are 40 years old and live in michigan the university psychology lecturer told the ny daily news adding that the racist neighborhood does not approve of his black friends although management of the co op owned high rise received the lawsuit yesterday the feud between mr kempter and his neighbors has been going on for years i opened my dishwasher on a clean load of dishes and the smell was overwhelming a neighbor wrote to management of the upper east side building in january 2010 blaming richard s stepson last january another complained it is 10 45pm and my apartment smells like a party was going on the stench of musty pot that is lingering in my closet is unbearable the lawsuit also includes accusations of lewd behavior after a woman named in the lawsuit as chrissy was caught on cctv going up to the roof terrace with two men after dark which is prohibited by co op rules no to smoke neighbours say the cannabis smoke from the wild parties in mr kempter s one bedroom flat has spread throughout the building into their homes even into their dishwashers and closets mr kempter who has lived in the building for 12 years said he was aware that there had been complaints regarding his guests getting rowdy and admitted that his friends probably did have sex on the roof but that the issues have already been resolved the board of the co op building had voted for him to be kicked out of the flat in march but after mr kempter promised that the wild parties would stop he was allowed to stay i think there s a racial issue here he told the paper adding that his friends named in the suit are all african american this is a very racist neighborhood the co op is seeking 15 000 in damages plus payment from kempter for their legal bills \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

for two things on sunday morning one it is the end of a difficult week and two sergio aguero plays for manchester city the argentine yet again dug his team out of a huge hole with a breathtaking double as city twice came from behind to snatch a draw at queens park rangers video scroll down for sportsmail s premier league big match stats qpr vs manchester city charlie austin who had already had two goals disallowed scores to put qpr ahead at home to the premier league champions sergio aguero follows up his brilliant control to fire past the despairing lunge of steven caulker and level the scores at loftus road bobby zamora celebrates after martin demichelis had headed into his own net to put qpr back ahead with 15 minutes to play aguero stays calm after rounding rob green to level for city again as the champions showed resolve to come back for a point referee mike dean explains his decision to the players after controversially but correctly disallowing charlie austin s strike qpr green isla caulker dunne yun vargas sandro henry fer austin zamora subs hill phillips barton mccarthy onuoha kranjcar hoilett man city hart sagna demichelis mangala clichy fernandinho fernando jesus navas toure nasri aguero subs zabaleta milner dzeko caballero lampard jovetic boyata referee mike dean city s defeat by cska moscow not to mention the red cards and pending european suspensions of yaya toure and fernandinho leaves pellegrini s men with a champions league mountain to climb so the manager was looking for a response and he would not have liked what he saw in the opening 20 minutes as qpr came flying out of the blocks rangers thought they had taken an eighth minute lead when charlie austin thumped a header from eduardo vargas s cross past joe hart only for the effort to be ruled out for offside then came a moment of controversy when from the resultant free kick austin thought he had grabbed the opener as hart took the free kick he inadvertently touched the ball with his standing foot and from his second touch the intentional kick went straight to austin the qpr striker smashed an 18 yard drive past hart to send loftus road into a frenzy once more though referee mike dean disallowed the goal qpr players were incensed supporters bewildered why on earth was that goal disallowed dean though was spot on with his decision fifa rules state that a free kick awarded to the defending team in their own box must be retaken if the ball does not leave the penalty area after the first touch hart s inadvertent first kick did not leave the area meaning the ball was not in play sergio aguero s first goal came from patient build up in the city half followed by a penatrating long ball see more in our match zone austin s first disallowed goal came from a header which he powered past joe hart but he was several yards offside from the resulting free kick hart stumbled slightly in his run up before appearing to give the ball straight to austin on the edge of the box hart had actually caught the ball with his standing foot meaning that he had played the ball twice in the box and had to retake the kick austin finished with aplomb but dean had already stopped the game and despite qpr feeling aggrieved the official was right hart s free kick was required to leave the box before the ball could be considered back in play so by touching it for a second time he prevented the ball from becoming live riley was correct but the sense of injustice only served to spur qpr on as they continued with their excellent start hart then produced an excellent point blank save to deny austin after bobby zamora laid off sandro s 14th minute cross city were let off the hook again later when riley rejected a strong penalty appeal after sandro s long range effort seemed to hit bacary sagna on the arm pellegrini s side were rattled and qpr finally took advantage in the 21st minute lively vargas found austin with a perfect through ball city protested for an offside but riley could not save them this time as austin in front of england manager roy hodgson scored his sixth of the season the champions were on the ropes a shadow of the team that secured their second title in three years last season toure went close to an equaliser but his shot drifted wide of rob green s far post qpr players surround the referee after seeing two goals disallowed inside a minute but mike dean stuck to his decision charlie austin who was also denied early on by a brilliant save from hart cannot believe how he still hasn t scored austin did eventually find the back of the net with a legal strike after 21 minutes his fourth goal in three premier league games yaya toure and eliaquim mangala look dispirited as manchester city were outplayed by qpr in the opening stages sergio aguero finished brilliantly as the champions scored on the break to level things up despite rob green s complaints england manager roy hodgson was at loftus road to watch charlie austin with the qpr striker in the frame for a rise from non league football to the england squad within six years austin s form saturday s was his sixth premier league goal of the season has impressed hodgson city needed a hero as ever up stepped aguero to dig them out of a hole eliaquim mangala s punt towards the argentine was hopeful but what followed was sheer brilliance aguero effortlessly pulled the ball out of the air twisted and turned past steven caulker before finishing past green where would city be without the south american his goal should have been the signal for city to take control toure twice failed to make the keeper work in good positions just outside the box though richard dunne was lucky not to see a red card after lashing out at samir nasri city did not look comfortable as their defensive frailties resurfaced hart denied austin after the england hopeful hammered a shot straight at the keeper and england s no 1 produced an even better save to deny austin from close range seconds later though the striker was ruled offside the argentinian striker celebrates his 10th premier league goal of the season although qpr believed there was a handball in the build up green was adamant that aguero had controlled the ball with his arm in the lead up to the goal but it was allowed to stand harry redknapp cannot believe what he is seeing as despite having the ball in the net three times his side went into half time level leroy fer battles with bacary sagna as qpr showed passion and quality against a manchester city side badly lacking form mins pld km miles qpr 109 3 67 9 karl henry 90 11 7 7 3 bobby zamora 90 11 0 6 8 suk young yun 90 10 8 6 7 manchester city 108 7 67 5 jesus navas 90 11 6 7 2 bacary sagna 90 10 9 6 7 fernando 90 10 8 6 7 as if the first half was not exhilarating enough rangers boss harry redknapp sent on joey barton for sandro at half time and the entertainment continued during the early stages of the second half toure nasri and jesus navas all firing dangerous low crosses without finding a team mate qpr did not sit back either leroy fer watching his drive from 16 yards fly inches wide after a deflection off martin demichelis while caulker fired an effort wide city fans were calling for frank lampard and they got their wish when he was introduced for sub edin dzeko but lampard was helpless as he watched qpr regain the lead in the 76th minute as austin turned provider firing in a great cross and demichelis put into his own net under pressure from zamora the argentine put his hands together as if to pray indeed his side needed divine inspiration they nearly got it just two minutes after falling behind when barton sent aguero clear with a poor header the argentine cooly skipped past green but dunne was on hand to clear his effort caulker followed suit soon after clearing james milner s header off the line before green saved toure s follow up strike but just like the first half city were rescued by their sensational argentine latching onto toure s excellent pass aguero s control was exquisite as he slotted past green in the 83rd minute to earn a draw mangala who struggled throughout in the absence of vincent kompany climbs all over austin conceding a free kick zamora celebrates with eduardo vargas after his pressure caused demichelis to head austin s cross into the corner of his own net zamora congratulates austin for his excellent performance after the striker s cross produced the vital second goal for qpr city look shell shocked but they bounced back immediately through aguero to rescue a point at loftus road yaya toure drives past joey barton as the champions looked for an unlikely winner having been behind twice in the game vargas tries what would have been a remarkable winner but despite his excellent technique the ball sailed just wide \\nSummary:charlie austin has two goals disallowed in a minute early on austin eventually scored a legal goal to put qpr in the lead after 21 minutes sergio aguero hit back for manchester city with brilliant finish in 32nd minute martin demichelis own goal puts qpr back ahead before aguero levels again '"

outbreak of a rare strain of e coli that has spread to 10 countries and is blamed for at least 16 deaths and hundreds of illnesses nine patients in germany had died of a form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome or hus according to the world health organization which cited tuesday figures as its most recent six had died of enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec a strain of e coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines and can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea one person in sweden has also died across europe 499 cases of hus and 1 115 cases of ehec have been reported who said on its website in addition to germany and sweden cases have been identified in austria denmark france netherlands norway spain switzerland and the united kingdom all but two of the cases occurred in people who had recently visited northern germany or in one case had contact with a visitor from northern germany the organization said scientists at the beijing genomic institute said the outbreak of infection in germany is caused by a new super toxic e coli strain though the u s centers for disease control and prevention said the strain has been seen before we have very little experience with this particular strain but it has been seen before said robert tauxe deputy director of the cdc s division of foodborne diseases the cdc said the strain is very rare and added that while it is not aware of any cases ever having been reported in the united states it is aware of a few previous reports of the strain in other countries britain s health protection agency has said that the strain suspected in the outbreak is rare and seldom seen in the uk though who said it does not recommend any trade restrictions related to the outbreak russia announced a ban thursday on fresh vegetable imports from the european union russia imposed the vegetable ban because no one wants to get sick it is a natural protective measure taken in response to events that are happening in europe today russian foreign ministry spokesman alexander lukashevich said thursday gennady onishchenko head of the russian federal agency for health and consumer rights issued a statement saying the ban will remain in effect until we become convinced that this situation is resolved customs officials have been instructed to prevent the produce from entering the country according to onishchenko while supermarkets and food chains in russia were told to withdraw european vegetables from their produce bins frederic vincent the european commission s health spokesman called the move disproportionate the commission will be writing today to the russian authorities and we will be liaising and working with them in the coming days to try to find a solution vincent said the commission is the eu s executive body yelena skrynnik russia s agriculture minister issued a statement assuring russians that despite the ban the volume of home grown vegetable production combined with exports from other countries is sufficient to fully meet russia s domestic demand in 2010 the imports of tomatoes and cucumbers from the eu amounted to respectively 11 and 5 of all imports of those vegetables into russia the russian agriculture ministry said the ban could potentially affect some larger cities in the european part of the country where about 90 of vegetables are imported said sergey shugayev chairman of the rural russia association china and turkey are the two largest exporters of fresh vegetables into russia according to the russian greenhouses association the european food safety alert network initially said ehec was found in organic cucumbers originating from spain packaged in germany and distributed to countries including austria the czech republic denmark germany hungary luxembourg and spain but authorities said thursday the source had not been pinpointed spain s ministry of health social politics and equality said thursday that all samples of spanish produce that it analyzed had proved negative spain s ambassador to britain carles casajuana i palet told cnn that spanish produce had been completely cleared and are safe for all consumers but he added the matter had damaged the country s growers and we are sure there will have to be compensations through the european union britain s health protection agency on thursday confirmed that there were four new cases in england suspected to be related to the outbreak bringing the total number of cases in the country to seven the agency said that it was reminding people traveling to germany to follow the advice of the authorities and avoid eating raw tomatoes cucumbers and leafy salad including lettuce especially in the north of the country until further notice in addition anyone returning from germany with illness including bloody diarrhea should seek urgent medical attention and make sure they mention their recent travel history the ban on fresh vegetables from the european union comes three days after russia blocked the import of fresh tomatoes cucumbers and salad greens from germany and spain on wednesday the united arab emirates imposed a temporary ban on cucumbers from spain germany denmark and the netherlands cnn s maxim tkachenko contributed to this report \\nSummary:new spain s produce safe for all consumers spanish official says at least 16 people have died in the outbreak and hundreds have

en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder or work out how long it will take them to get there based on current traffic emu is slightly more advanced because it additionally scans and monitors conversations in real time to offer these suggestions automatically and with context if a friend asks a user where they are emu can send the location on a map or if a friend asks to meet up on a particular day emu will check the user s calendar to see if they re free automatically location details can even be updated live for 30 minutes emu additionally scans and monitors conversations in real time to offer these suggestions automatically and with context if a friend asks a user where they are emu can send the location on a map or if a friend asks to meet up on a particular day emu will check the user s calendar to see if they re free automatically location details can even be updated live for 30 minutes all the recommendations are based on contextual information it obtains from a person s phone emu was founded in 2012 by california based ex google and apple employee gummi hafsteinsson its machine learning capabilities could provide google now with added context and faster response times across different devices the emu team confirmed the acquisition in a blog post on wednesday hey did you hear we re joining google that s right and we re super excited but to focus on our next chapter we have to close the last one as of august 25 2014 we ll be shutting down the emu app it will no longer be available in the app store and existing users won t be able to send receive or download messages we know it s an inconvenience and we regret that to our friends advisors and users we ve learned so much with your help and we re grateful for all your support emu s machine learning capabilities could provide google now pictured with added context and faster response times across different devices the acquistion was confirmed in a blog post on wednesday but details of the deal have not been revealed it is not known how much google paid for emu and mailonline has contacted the company for more information this isn t google s first foray into artificial intelligence in january the firm bought artificial intelligence firm deepmind its hummingbird search update last year was created to make google more human and searches can now understand context like a human brain for example google also hired futurist ray kurzweil as engineering director in 2012 kurzweil has famously claimed that in just over 30 years humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal an event called singularity he also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100 \\nSummary:emu was founded by ex google and apple employee gummi hafsteinsson it works in a similar way to personal assistant apps google now and siri but emu claims it is different because the app relies on machine learning this means it can learn behaviours and fine tune suggestions for users it works by monitoring conversations for contextual data in real time if someone asks to meet up it automatically checks a calendar for example \",\n          \"Summarize the following article: \\n\\nby sara malm published 12 10 est 10 january 2013 updated 12 10 est 10 january 2013 a new york man is being sued by his neighbors for allegedly allowing his children to take drugs and have threesomes on the roof of their luxury apartment building richard kempter 73 is accused of letting cannabis fuelled parties take place in his one bedroom flat when he is not around leaving the entire manhattan high rise reeking of marijuana but mr kempter has hit back saying that the lawsuit is racially motivated and targets his personal guests as his children live miles away in a different state sue for smell the neighbors allege that mr kempter who lives on the eight floor of this building on the upper east side allows his children to smoke cannabis and have sex on the roof when he is away my children are 40 years old and live in michigan the university psychology lecturer told the ny daily news adding that the racist neighborhood does not approve of his black friends although management of the co op owned high rise received the lawsuit yesterday the feud between mr kempter and his neighbors has been going on for years i opened my dishwasher on a clean load of dishes and the smell was overwhelming a neighbor wrote to management of the upper east side building in january 2010 blaming richard s stepson last january another complained it is 10 45pm and my apartment smells like a party was going on the stench of musty pot that is lingering in my closet is unbearable the lawsuit also includes accusations of lewd behavior after a woman named in the lawsuit as chrissy was caught on cctv going up to the roof terrace with two men after dark which is prohibited by co op rules no to smoke neighbours say the cannabis smoke from the wild parties in mr kempter s one bedroom flat has spread throughout the building into their homes even into their dishwashers and closets mr kempter who has lived in the building for 12 years said he was aware that there had been complaints regarding his guests getting rowdy and admitted that his friends probably did have sex on the roof but that the issues have already been resolved the board of the co op building had voted for him to be kicked out of the flat in march but after mr kempter promised that the wild parties would stop he was allowed to stay i think there s a racial issue here he told the paper adding that his friends named in the suit are all african american this is a very racist neighborhood the co op is seeking 15 000 in damages plus payment from kempter for their legal bills \\nSummary:neighbours sue over rowdy cannabis parties in upper east side flat fellow inhabitants of manhattan high rise blame the owner s children mr kempter says lawsuit is racially motivated but admits friends probably did have a threesome on the roof top terrace \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
